# pivot-login-page
 
this is my final project for the pre-work section of the pivot program! this was by far the most difficult project, but I was able to do it all in one sitting without *too* much outside help! <a href="https://jhbforlife-pivot-login-page.netlify.app">you can view it deployed here!</a>

improvements for the future:
- the right side isn't centered the same way as the left side
- overflow on mobile
- landscape mode on mobile
